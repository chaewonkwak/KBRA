Keywords Best Represent the Account (KBRA)

KBRA generates best keywords of Instagram accounts from what they post. It crawls photos and classify labels to determine which keyword best represents each account. 
We adopt CLIP model for classification. KBRA can be used to mitigate the cold start and other marketing/recommendataion system.
